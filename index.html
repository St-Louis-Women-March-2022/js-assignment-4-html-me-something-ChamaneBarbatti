   <h3> Chamane Barbatti </h3>
   <p>
      Chamane Barbatti has been an actress for over 20 years and has been an intricate part of The United Artist Network since it was established and has been able to tap into that comedic side of her talent because of it, allowing her to stretch her talent to a new level. Acting has always been her dream and so she’s made a lot of sacrifices in her life to do what she loves to do. She wants to make a living doing what she loves instead of working at what she hates. Girls Night Out gives her an outlet and multiple opportunities to expand on what she’s always wanted to do. With the help of her partner Dearra, and the guests involved, she hopes to be able to create her legacy.

   <h3> Dearra Johnson </h3>
   <p>
      Girls Night Out will be Dearra Johnson’s first ever main feature roll in a show. She has taken part in smaller segments in the past few years but now she’s coming out swinging and smiling. She’s always wanted to be an actress but due to her dyslexia she’s always kept her dreams at bay. So she decided to go work behind the scenes in production, directing, script writing, and set building so that when she finally had the courage to step in front of the camera she would be well rounded in all aspects of her field. She’s a YouTuber and started a channel for YouTube (One in the same with Dearra) and that’s how she got her start in being in front of a camera. You tube, like for a lot of other new actors and actresses, helped provide her a way to face her fears and gain more confidence. She hopes to gain more confidence in herself on camera and is hopeful, that with Chamane’s help, she will be able to step out into the main stream acting field without any fear any longer.
